## Diabetes Prediction Model
Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction Model project! This project focuses on developing a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on various medical and lifestyle factors. Aimed at assisting healthcare professionals in early detection and prevention, this model emphasizes accuracy and efficiency in its predictions.

## Project Objective
The primary objective is to create a reliable machine learning model capable of predicting diabetes in patients, utilizing a dataset that comprises medical and lifestyle variables. This tool is especially designed for healthcare settings to facilitate early diagnosis and intervention.

## Abstract
Dataset: Trained on 768 observations and 9 variables from Kaggle, exclusively featuring female patients of Pima Indian ancestry, aged 21 or older.
Algorithms: Five machine learning algorithms â€“ Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and KNeighborsClassifier.
Evaluation: The model's performance is assessed using a confusion matrix and metrics such as accuracy, mean squared error, and ROC curve accuracy.
## Key Findings:
The SVM model showed the highest accuracy (82.468%) on the test dataset.
K-nearest neighbors followed closely with 79.221% accuracy.
Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree demonstrated reasonable performance.
Glucose level emerged as a significant predictor of diabetes.
## Getting Started
Prerequisites
